# MemoryManager (Operating Systems Project)

## Overview
MemoryManager is a simulation of how an **Operating System manages memory**.  
The project models memory allocation and deallocation, providing insights into  
how OSes track and optimize memory usage for processes.

This project was developed as part of an **Operating Systems course assignment**.

## Features
- Simulation of memory allocation strategies
- Memory tracking and management
- Process loading and unloading
- Fragmentation handling
- Console-based input/output
